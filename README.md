# Week 6 Knowledge Dump

There's not much here yet, except for some nearly-empty documents and a bunch of issues.

Start conversations around the issues you'd like to address. Then fork this repo, clone your fork, and start writing content to address the issues. Push content to your fork, then open a pull request to this repo. Ask another student to review your pr and leave some feedback; if it's warranted, update your PR. Once the PR is ready for me to review, @-mention me and I'll take a look.
