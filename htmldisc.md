# In-Depth HTML Discussion

## What is HTML?
In Front-End Software Engineering, the  **HTML** document is what gives structured content to webpages and applications. Combined with CSS and JavaScript, HTML is the backbone of Front-End engineering.

> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure. An HTML document is a plaintext document structured with elements. Elements are surrounded by matching opening and closing tags. Each tag begins and ends with angle brackets (<>). There are a few empty or void  tags that cannot enclose any text, for instance <img>.

## Structure (in code)

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title></title>
      </head>
      <body>
         <!--Content Goes Here!-->    
      </body>
    </html>

## Syntax & Best Practices
1. Always use the correct **Document** type (as shown above).
2. Indent new sections of code for a cleaner look.
3. Place external CSS files within the head tag. Try not to use inline styles.
4. When linking to JavaScript files, place all <script> tags right above the closing </body> tag.
5. Make sure all image tags have a relevant "alt" attribute in case the actual image cannot be displayed.
6. Always close your tags!

## Closing Arguments
It's imperative that all Front-End Developers become fluently skilled in writing **HTML** code. The quicker a developer can master HTML the sooner they can spend more time cultivating mastery for CSS and JavaScript.
