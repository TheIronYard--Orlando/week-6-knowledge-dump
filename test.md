Test driven development is a process that relies on the repitition of very specific test cases
to draft and improve your code and insures that all code is written with the goal of solving a problem.
The main difference in this process of writing code is that you start with writing a failing test that makes the developer focus on understanding the features specifications and requirements before writing any code.

TDD often leads to more modularized, flexible, and functional code since the methodology requires that the developers think of the software in terms of small units that can be written and tested independently and integrated together later.

some of the down sides are
-It necessitates a lot of time and effort up front which can make development feel slow to begin with.
-Focusing on the simplest design now and not thinking ahead can mean major refactoring requirements.
-It takes time and effort to maintain the test suite and it must be reconfigured for maximum value.
-If the design is changing rapidly then youâ€™ll need to keep changing your tests. You could end up wasting a lot of time writing tests for features that are quickly dropped.
