A task runner is an extremely useful tool for front end applications.
Common tasks like watching for file changes, concatenating/minifying files prefixing
files for different browsers and linting javascript are automated in order to lighten the
everyday worldload of programers.

A package manager concentrates mainly on finding,
 installing, and updating packages.

A alternative to using a task runner like grunt or gulp is using npm as both a package manager
and a task manager as well. which is useful often simpler and less code than grunt or gulp and its all
in your packages.json file instead of its own grunt or gulpfile.

If there was no package managers like npm or bower you would either have to link all your packages in your
html and you would have to manage the packages manually or right all your applications from scratch both of which
is undesired and tedious.
